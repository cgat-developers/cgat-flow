# Options for running each enrichment analysis
############################################################
analysis:
    # Analysis type, options are:
    # ORA  (Over Representative Analysis)
    ora: 1

    ###########################################################
    # Parameters for ORA analysis
db:
    # path to a database generated using pipeline_geneinfo.py
    name: /path/to/db
    # common name of species - human, mouse, rat etc.
    species: human

id:
    # which gene id type is used for the input gene lists
    # can be ensemblg, entrez or symbol
    # the analysis will be based on this ID type and the all genes background will be
    # all IDs of this type in this organism
    # NOTE - if this is ensemblg, all ensemblg IDs will be used as a background, including multiple
    # identifiers for the same gene
    # for symbol, append the scientific name of the species the gene ids are from
    # e.g. symbol_Homo_sapiens, symbol_Mus_musculus
    type: symbol_Homo_sapiens


stats:
    # details of statistical tests for enrichment

    # how to identifiy enriched terms - currently implemented are termbyterm - look for
    # enrichment of each term irrespective of other terms and elim - prioritise
    # more derived parts of the ontology using the elim method described in 
    # http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/13/1600.full.pdf
    runtype: elim

    # which statistical test to use to look for enrichment of each term
    # currently only Fisher has been implemented
    testtype: Fisher

    # correction for multiple testing to apply - currently only bon (bonferroni)
    # has been implemented
    correction: bon

    # minimum significant accepted pvalue
    thresh: 0.05

    # if 1 write the lists of genes in the foreground and background which are
    # annotated to the most enriched terms in each database to tsv files
    # in the results.dir directory
    writegenes: 1
    # the number of enriched terms for which to write gene lists for each database
    # using a high number here may result in a very large number of files
    # as file count will be number of foregrounds * number of backgrounds * ngenes
    ngenes: 5

annotation_flatfiles:
    # strings specifying the options for parsing any additional files containing annotations
    # options are described in the pipeline module file
    # any number of flatfiles can be specified in this section as 1=, 2=, 3= etc.
